# Xenoblade Checklist
This project is to help people keep track of everything that they have done in all of the Xenoblade Chronicles games. This should help players get to that lofty 100% completion goal in no time!

## How it Works
By going to this link {INSERT LINK HERE} and signing up for an account you can list exactly what you consider to be 100% for each individual game (all sidequests, all unique beasts, all challenges, etc.). Afterwards the you will be taken to a page where you can select the game of choice that you would like to start with (only Xenoblade Chronicles 3 works right now but I am working on the other 3 games and 3 side stories!). From there you should be able to start checking off everything that you have done.

## Features (Add Screenshots Later)
- Guides for each quest and where to locate them
- Combat related guides with video tutorials for you to get the most out of the combat system for each game
- Clean UI fit for both Desktop computers and mobile devices
- Keep track of your current progress in the game

## Future Features

    - Xenoblade Chronicles 2: Torna the Golden Country
  - Xenoblade Chronicles X
  - And the DLC side story for Xenoblade Chronicles 3 which at the time of writing we don't know the name of
- Percentage counter e.g. "You are 70% done"

#### Aditional Techy Stuff
This project is fully open source and I implore people to fork it and use it as a base to develop a similar system for a franchise they enjoy (FF, Zelda, Persona, etc.). I give full rights to anyone that wants to use my code to create something new.

## Conclusion
I hope everyone is excited for this projects eventual completion and I hope that it helps new players get into these games as I know that they can be alot sometimes. Especially Definitive Edition with it's 95 128 side quests. (Source: https://kotaku.com/how-to-manage-all-95-128-side-quests-in-xenoblade-chron-1843735325).

I plan to start with Xenoblade Chronicles 3 first as it is the most recent release and then move my way through the rest of the series. Most likely in reverse order (3 DLC if out at the time, 2, Torna, Definitive Edition, Future Connected, then finally X).

This has been one of my favourite series ever since I was a kid and I hope this service helps others get into it as well. Especially since a majority of them are on the Switch now!
